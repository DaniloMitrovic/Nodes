Installation
------------

For FreeCAD version 0.21 or higher, it is recommended to download and install the Nodes Workbench via the FreeCAD's
Addon Manager (**Tools â†’ Addon Manager**). The required Python modules ``qtpy`` and ``awkward`` are automatically
installed this way. For older FreeCAD versions and Realthunder's Link Branch, these modules must be installed manually
via PIP.

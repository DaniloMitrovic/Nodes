Installation
------------

For FreeCAD version 0.21 or higher, it is recommended to download and install the Nodes Workbench via the Addon Manager
(**Tools â†’ Addon Manager**). The required Python modules `qtpy <https://pypi.org/project/QtPy/>`_ and
`awkward <https://awkward-array.org/doc/main/>`_ are automatically installed this way. For older FreeCAD versions and
Realthunder's Link Branch, these modules must be installed manually
via PIP.

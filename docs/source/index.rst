Welcome to the FreeCAD Nodes Workbench documentation!
===================================

**The FreeCAD Nodes Workbench** offers a graphical algorithm editor for the parametric 3D modeler
`FreeCAD <https://www.freecadweb.org>`_. By connecting function blocks (nodes) in series or parallel, complex 3D models
can be created, processed or animated.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including the :ref:`installation` of the addon via
FreeCAD's Addon Manager.
